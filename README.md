==============================

Final Project for CSE 145A/B at UC Irvine Winter 2012, by Scott Gettinger and Ashwin Amit

The project was an audio equalizer running on an ATMega32 microcontroller.
Used an LCD for output and a connection on the ATMega32 for audio input from a 3.5mm audio jack.
Calculates frequency-domain data using a fast-fourier-transform library called "ffft" from "ChaN" (http://elm-chan.org/).

The main() function is located in AVRGCC4/AVRGCC4/AVRGCC4.c
