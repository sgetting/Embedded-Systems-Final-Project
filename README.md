==============================

Final Project for CSE 145A/B at UC Irvine Winter 2012, by Scott Gettinger and Ashwin Amit

The project, chosen by the team members, was to create an audio frequency display running on an ATMega32 microcontroller.
Used an LCD for output and a connection on the ATMega32 for audio input from a 3.5mm audio jack.
Calculates frequency-domain data using a fast-fourier-transform library called "ffft" from "ChaN" (http://elm-chan.org/).

Language: C

The main() function is located in AVRGCC4/AVRGCC4/AVRGCC4.c
